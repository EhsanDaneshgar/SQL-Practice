# Ehsan's SQL & Data Analytics Practice Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my learning journey and hands-on practice in **SQL**, **T-SQL**, and **data analytics** using Microsoft tools like **SSMS**, **SSIS**, and **Power BI**.

Iâ€™m building this portfolio as part of my transition into **data engineering and analytics**, and using real-world databases like **AdventureWorksDW2019** and scenarios from **HackerRank** to improve my skills.
