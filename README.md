# Ehsan's SQL & Data Analytics Practice Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my learning journey and hands-on practice in **SQL**, **T-SQL**, and **data analytics** using Microsoft tools like **SSMS**, **SSIS**, and **Power BI**.

I‚Äôm building this portfolio as part of my transition into **data engineering and analytics**, and using real-world databases like **AdventureWorksDW2019** and scenarios from **HackerRank** to improve my skills.

## üìò What‚Äôs Included

- **SQL queries** for real data scenarios (aggregation, joins, filtering, subqueries)
- **Explanations** (in English and sometimes Persian) to reinforce my understanding
- **SSIS integration practice**: screenshots, data flow tasks, error handling
- **Power BI dashboards** (coming soon): storytelling with data

## üõ† Tools & Skills Practiced

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- **T-SQL**
- **AdventureWorksDW** sample database
- **SQL Joins**, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `IN`, `NOT IN`, etc.
